# CannaButter Calculator 🌿

A free, public-facing web tool that helps you measure the exact amount of cannabis to use when making infused butter, based on the THC percentage of your cannabis and how much butter you want to end up with.

> Hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Features

- **Mode 1 – How much cannabis do I need?**

- **Mode 2 – What potency will I get?**  
  Enter the amount of cannabis you have, its THC %, and how much butter you're making. The calculator shows the resulting mg THC per tablespoon and per teaspoon.

- Adjustable **infusion efficiency** slider (40–90 %) to account for different decarboxylation and infusion methods.
- Fully responsive — works on desktop and mobile.
- No sign-up, no ads, no tracking. Runs entirely in the browser.
